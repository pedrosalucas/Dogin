## 🐾 Courses 
This project came from two courses, [React](https://www.origamid.com/curso/react-completo/) and [Redux](https://www.origamid.com/curso/redux-com-react) courses. In React course was made the majority part of the project, like the pages, routes, events, and API usage. And in the Redux course, the context of the states was refactored to use Redux mechanisms.

## 🐾 Tests
In addition to the topics covered in the courses, I've been building unit tests using Jest. To do that, I studied the [React Testing](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-testing) course at CodeAcademy, the free part, and a lot of Googling 😂.

## 🐾 What I Learned
I learned to build an App by React using things like states context and getting data by API. I also used Styled Components to style the components and develop tests to guarantee that the App works expectedly.
